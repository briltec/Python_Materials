Follow the tutorial to [Build This Weather CLI App with Python](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-weather-app-cli/) using only modules from Python's standard library.

## Requirements

To run this CLI app, you need a modern installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.6.

**Note:** This app was developed on macOS for the [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) shell. Your mileage with some of the color display and emojis may vary depending on your setup. On Windows, [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) displays the formatting reasonably well.

You also need an [API key for OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/appid). After signing up and generating your API key, add it to the `secrets.ini` config file:

```
[openweathermap]
api_key = <YOUR-OPENWEATHERAPP-API-KEY>
```

**Note:** Make sure that `secrets.ini` is not tracked by your version control system, to avoid leaking your API key to the public.

For more information on the OpenWeather API used in this CLI app, check out the [documentation on the city name endpoint](https://openweathermap.org/current#name).

## Usage example

Once you're set up, you can call the weather CLI by running:

```bash
$ python weather.py <CITY_NAME> [-i]
```

For example, to get the current weather in Vienna, Austria, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ python weather.py Vienna
```

To display the temperature in Fahrenheit, you can add the optional `-i` or `--imperial` flag.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [associated Real Python tutorial](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-weather-app-cli/)._

## Development setup

To run and continue development on this CLI project, you need to have **Python>=3.6** installed on your system.
