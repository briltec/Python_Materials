# Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter

A tic-tac-toe game built with Python and Tkinter. It allows two players to play a tic-tac-toe game on a shared device.

## Installation

The game uses Tkinter to build its user interface. Since Tkinter is part of the Python standard library, you don't need to install anything to run the game. Just make sure that you have a version of Tkinter greater than 8.5.

## Run the Game

To run the game, just execute the following command on your command line:

```sh
$ python tic_tac_toe.py
```
