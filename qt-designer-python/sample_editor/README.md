# Sample Text Editor

A **sample text editor** that shows how to use Qt Designer to create GUI applications.

## How to Run this Application

To run this application, you need to [install `PyQt5`](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#installing-pyqt) on your Python environment. To do that, you can run the following commands in a terminal or command prompt:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv ./venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install PyQt5
```

Once you have [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/) installed, you can run the application by executing the following command:

```sh
(venv) $ cd sample_editor/
(venv) $ python app.py
```

This command will launch the application, so you'll be able to experiment with it.
