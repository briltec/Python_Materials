# Build a Chatbot with Python and Chatterbot

This repository contains code related to the tutorial on [building a Python chatbot with chatterbot](https://realpython.com/build-a-chatbot-python-chatterbot/).

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), then install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python -m pip install chatterbot pytz
```

Then you can train and start the interactive CLI bot by running `bot.py`:

```sh
(venv) $ python bot.py
```

After training, you'll see an interactive prompt that you can chat with:

```text
> hi
ðŸª´ Welcome, friend ðŸ¤—
> thanks for the green welcome
ðŸª´ I let you
> you let me be here?
ðŸª´ It's a monsters!
> did you mean monstera?
ðŸª´ The leafs that she had are getting dryer and dryer. But sheâ€™s also growing plenty of new ones
> who?
ðŸª´ Do raindrops touch their leaves?
> very philosophical!
ðŸª´ Lol
> ;)
ðŸª´ I don't grow any crop at home
> no crops in pots
ðŸª´ Ah, gotcha!
```

The bot will learn from the replies you give and improve its accuracy. You can quite the interactive prompt by typing any of the `exit_conditions` defined in `bot.py`.
